## Alexa Wookiepeedia Info Skill

This project demonstrates how to build an Alexa skill - no Amazon Echo required! It's a useful project to learn the basics of creating Alexa Skills.

It implements Big Nerd Ranch's [Airport Info app](https://github.com/bignerdranch/alexa-airportinfo), which tells you details about delays and weather conditions at a particular airport in response to an airport code.
