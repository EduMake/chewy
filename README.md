## Alexa Wookiepeedia Info Skill

Answers your Star Wars questions using Wookiepedia. The Alexa app is available for free [here - not yet](#)

It is super easy to remix this project to make Alexa answer the worlds questions about your favourite game / movie / TV show etc.

This project demonstrates how to build an Alexa skill - no Amazon Echo required! It's a useful project to learn the basics of creating Alexa Skills. 

It uses Gabriel Pedro's [node-wikia](https://github.com/gpedro/node-wikia) , which fetches data from Wookiepeedia and can be remixed to work with any of the 360,000+ [wikia](http://wikia.com/) fandom sites. Which means you can easily setup Alexa to answer questions on your favourite game in less than an hour.
