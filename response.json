He was the son of the redeemed Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, the grandson of Shmi Skywalker Lars, the grandson of both Ruwee Naberrie and Jobal Naberrie, the step-nephew of Owen and Beru Lars, the twin brother of Leia Organa and the uncle of Ben Solo. Skywalker and his sister were born in 19 BBY on the asteroid Polis Massa, unbeknownst to their father, the recently christened Sith Lord Darth Vader. After his mother died in labor, Skywalker was separated from his sister and taken by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to the planet Tatooine to be raised by the Lars family, out of sight of the Galactic Empire."

Though Kenobi was killed by Vader, Skywalker participated in the Battle of Yavin alongside the Rebels with guidance from Kenobi's spirit, and managed to destroy the Death Star."

Artoo's suggestion did, however, give the young Jedi an idea: to venture into the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the former home of the Jedi Order. Before he could travel to Coruscant, however, Skywalker set a course to Nar Shaddaa, a world of pirates and outlaws known as the \"Smuggler's Moon.\" Upon landing, Skywalker set off looking for someone who could help him get to the Jedi Temple. He entered a cantina, where he was immediately attacked by criminals looking to rob and kill him. Skywalker brandished his lightsaber and demanded that they cease their attack, while the bartender asked where he acquired a Jedi's lightsaber. He did not answer, instead saying that he was simply on Nar Shaddaa to conduct business and had already stated his purpose for entering the establishment. The bartender guessed that Skywalker was seeking entry into the Jedi Temple, meaning he would need to hire someone who could sneak him onto the capital world of the Empire. The bartender told him that he could do that for the boy, but the price would be the lightsaber—a price that Skywalker rejected, so the bartender resorted to his previous plan of killing and robbing the boy."

Though Skywalker had no experience with holocrons, the Hutt gave him five seconds to open the holocron or be killed. Under threat of death, the boy reached out with the Force and was able to open the holocron, as well as the many others that were in the collection. They revealed themselves as containing historical records about the Jedi and the Sith, including the revelation that there was a Jedi Temple on Vrogas Vas. With Skywalker having proved himself, Grakkus believed he would make a fine addition to his collection as the last living Jedi. Grakkus planned to put Skywalker into an arena fight that he would bill as the death of the last Jedi, so the Hutt ordered him taken to the arena's gamemaster to be prepared. Artoo, knowing that Skywalker had been captured, send a distress call to the Alliance Fleet, where it was intercepted by the High Command.

Upon arriving to Er'Kit to investigate, Skywalker felt mysterious echoes in the Force, which made him think there was more going on there than met the eye. Thus, he requested the help of an agent who had a reputation for desert warfare. Together, the two defeated the outposts and bases of the mercenaries. In order to ensure faster progress, Skywalker and the agent discovered from the Imperial operatives present in the sector that Imperial supplies had been ferried to Er'Kit via Nar Shaddaa, which meant a big operation. Eventually, Skywalker and the agent arrested the mercenary leader. Skywalker then successfully tracked the last members of the Malachor Company, who had holed themselves in an empty village."

After successfully parrying a flurry of blows, Luke would send Vader tumbling down a stairwell before regaining his composure and appealing to the good in his father. Vader, for his part, would have none of it and attacked. Again, Luke was able to fend-off his attacker and, citing a conflict Skywalker had sensed in his father's intentions, stated his refusal to continue with the fight. Eventually, Vader would send Luke scurrying into a corner of the throne room, where Skywalker would bide his time hiding in darkness. While searching for Luke's whereabouts, Vader began to use the Force to probe his son's mind, eventually uncovering the existence of Luke's twin sister. Grasping his opening, Vader announced that if Luke continued to refuse to be turned to the dark side, then perhaps his sister would make for a more suitable candidate. Finally overcome with anger, an indignant Luke Skywalker dropped any pretense of holding back, emerging from the darkness and unleashing a ferocious, hate-fueled attack against his tormentor. Skywalker pummeled Vader, bringing one heavy blow after another down upon his father's blade and eventually driving the Sith Lord to his knees. With one final, devastating strike of his lightsaber, Skywalker sliced Vader's hand off at the wrist, sending it—and the weapon it still gripped—cascading down into the depths below. A cackling Sidious, pleased with Skywalker's unprecedented assault, encouraged Luke to kill his father and take Vader's place at the Emperor's side."

The tree, which once dwelled in the heart of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, was stolen by the Emperor after he came to power and converted the Jedi Temple into the Imperial Palace. Skywalker recruited Shara Bey to fly as his co-pilot on the mission, and, along with Artoo, they flew a stolen Imperial shuttle, Antarra, to Vetine. While en route, Skywalker told Bey about the plan, including how she would pose as ISB Agent Alecia Beck, using codes obtained by Solo and the Pathfinders during a raid on an ISB base at the Wretch of Tayron. Upon their arrival, Bey claimed she was Agent Beck and that she had arrived to perform an unannounced inspection. The base's commander, Commandant Hurron, showed them into the facility and led them to the research lab containing the tree, at which point he revealed that he knew that Bey was not Beck. Hurron questioned why two Rebels would break into the facility, and Skywalker explained the importance of the tree—which he found had two remaining fragments. Skywalker and Bey fought their way out of the base, making their way through numerous stormtroopers who attempted to stop their escape. Once back at Antarra, Hurron ordered his forces to throw thermal detonators at the escaping Rebels, but Skywalker used the Force to deflect them back, killing Hurron and several of his stormtroopers in an explosion."

Bey was unsure as to whether she wanted to leave the Rebels behind, but Skywalker's guidance helped Bey decide to leave the Alliance. The Jedi Knight gifted one of the tree fragments to her, as he had only expected to find one, believing that the important relic would be kept safe with Bey and her family. She and Dameron planted it outside of their new home on Yavin 4."

He was aided by Lor San Tekka, an explorer and member of the Church of the Force. San Tekka was old enough to remember the Jedi Knights before the Clone Wars, and he did not believe the Emperor's lies about how the Jedi betrayed the Old Republic.

He taught a number of Jedi disciples, and took on his nephew Ben Solo, the son of Leia Organa and Han Solo, as one of his apprentices. Ben's parents could tell that he felt the pull of the dark side of the Force and feared he was much like his grandfather, so they sent him to be trained by Skywalker in the hopes that it would help him. Instead, Ben became corrupted by a being called Snoke, a dark Force user who led the First Order as its Supreme Leader—and believed that a new generation of Jedi would destroy the resurgent Imperial war machine. Ben took on the name Kylo Ren and slaughtered the new Jedi, apparently destroying everything Skywalker had tried to build. Feeling responsible for what happened, Skywalker vanished into exile. No one knew for sure where he went, but those closest to him believed he went off in search of the first Jedi Temple. The Jedi Master eventually discovered the location of the Temple on an aquatic planet named Ahch-To, where he made his exile."

The information remained within the archives of the Empire, the access to which was severely restricted after the Galactic Civil War. The First Order was able to acquire most of the map, save for a fraction which was apparently stolen by Lor San Tekka. As he had downloaded most of the information possessed by the Empire during his time on the Death Star, R2-D2, Skywalker's faithful astromech, was also able to recover the contents of the map, but only by going into low power mode, which allowed him to sort through the wealth of information present in the Empire's archives."

Resistance fighter pilot Jessika Pava learned that Threepio, who also served in the Resistance, knew Skywalker and asked the droid to tell her a story about his former master. Threepio regaled her with the tale of Skywalker's encounter with Sarco Plank on Devaron, and how Skywalker kept his promise to Farnay and indeed returned to Devaron. Members of the First Order, however, had a less-than-ideal view of the Jedi Master; the First Order taught their followers, including stormtroopers like FN-2187, that Skywalker was an enemy who helped destroy the Empire. Despite knowing about Skywalker, the mystical elements of his life, as well as the Jedi in general, were seen as mythic rather than historic."

The First Order also learned of the map and sought it so they could destroy the one remaining Jedi. San Tekka gave the map to Dameron, who in turn gave it to his astromech droid BB-8, before Kylo Ren and the First Order arrived. Ren killed San Tekka and took Dameron into custody in the hopes of finding the map, while BB-8 came into the possession of a Jakku scavenger named Rey. Rey believed that Skywalker was only a myth, but she too possessed a latent Force ability that she had not yet discovered. Rey teamed with FN-2187, who took the name Finn after defecting from the First Order, and, with the help of Han Solo and Chewbacca, sought to return the map fragment to the Resistance. After Rey discovered the lightsaber that once belonged to both Anakin and Luke in the pirate castle belonging to Maz Kanata, a thousand year-old being who had knowledge of the Force, she began to unlock her own Force abilities. BB-8's map fragment was soon combined with R2-D2's, and together they provided a complete map to Skywalker's location. Rey took the lightsaber with her and found the old Jedi Master on an island on a remote world, presenting him with his father's old weapon as a symbol of the only hope that the galaxy had left."
